# Edsger-Sketch
An interactive learning tool to help teach students Dijkstra's algorithm.
Main file is 'src/Main.py' or 'dist/Main.exe'.

My A-level Python project for Computing. This project required me to go through the complete development process of a piece of software, including analysis of the current available resources, design, development and finally testing of my product, as documented in 'Documentation.pdf'.

This was the largest project I had attempted to date and I had been programming in Python which didnâ€™t enforce an object-orientated style. As this project was significantly substantial and required a GUI, something I had never attempted before, I had to self-teach myself both the object-orientated style and how to create a GUI. Although the object oriented aspect of my program could use improvement, I feel it demonstrates my ability to self-motivate and learn new techniques.
