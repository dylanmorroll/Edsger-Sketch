# Edsger-Sketch
An interactive learning tool to help teach students Dijkstra's algorithm.

My A-level Python project for Computing. This project required me to go through the complete development process of a piece of software, including analysis of the current available resouces, design, development and finally testing of my product, as documented in 'Documentation.pdf'

Main file is 'Main.py' or 'Main.exe'
